# Sparse

Sparse is a programming language designed around making <u>**s**</u>tring <u>**parse**</u>rs.

It operates on a "master value" and commands can change it.

There are only three data types, ints, strings, and arrays of the other types, and some commands will only work on certain data types.

For an example sparse program, check out [test.sparse](test.sparse) and [test.txt](test.txt)
